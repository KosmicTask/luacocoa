Version: 0.1.2
==============

API
===

* grammar.lua received two new utility functions: anyOf and listOf

Bugs Fixed
==========

* adding scanner's keywords e symbols to parser's rules ended up altering 
  scanner.keywords and scanner.symbols as well; using grammar.complete instead
  of grammar.apply does the trick.
  
* grammar.apply was inadvertently piping the captures to grammar instead of 
  rules if rules was nil.

Documentation
=============

* changes in the documentation generator made the new docs slightly different;
  no big conceptual change.

* an improved README file

* a COPYRIGHT file with Leg's license

* and this release file
