INTRODUCTION
============

Objective Lua is a toy to experiment with welding the Objective C class
semantics on top of Lua. It is in no way finished, or even useful.
Functionality is extremely limited and that functionality is, in places,
actually broken. However, it does provide a working means of trying out the
syntax and writing test programs to play with it. 



INSTALLATION
============

Installation? Ha.

You need to install the Leg Lua grammar, which can be found here, into your
Lua module path:

  http://leg.luaforge.net/

Now you can run the Objective Lua compiler with:

  lua oluac.lua <infile> <outfile>
  
This will convert an Objective Lua source file into a traditional Lua one,
which can then be run with a standard Lua interpreter:

  lua <outfile>
  
(You need the Objective Lua runtime --- olua.lua --- on your module path.
The current directory will do fine.)



DOCUMENTATION
=============

There is none. The code is tiny, and should be simple enough to understand.
There's a discussion of the rationale behind Objective Lua on the website at:

  http://www.cowlark.com/objective-lua
  
Meanwhile, here is a manifest so you know what you're looking at:

  README - this file.
  COPYING - the license.
  oluac.lua - the Objective Lua compiler.
  olua.lua - the Objective Lua runtime.
  test.olua - the example program and minimal Object class definition.
  


DISCLAIMER
==========

Objective Lua is EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE!

It is NOT EVEN ALPHA!

DO NOT USE IT for ANYTHING!

If bad stuff happens DO NOT BLAME ME because YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!



LEGAL STUFF
